Q5PriorityQueue
5. Implement a Java program to demonstrate the application of the java built-in data structure – priority queue. The application considers a list of printing jobs is maintained by a priority queue in the operating system of a server computer. When allocating CPU cycles to handle the printing jobs, the operating system uses the file size as the criteria to select next printing job (assume smaller file would be printed out first). It is obvious that the print job should be comparable based on the file size. Your program should include two classes:
-  PrintJob
-  PriorityQueueApplication

The PrintJob class defines the user name and the file size (to be printed) and implements the Comparable interface. The PriorityQueueApplication class declares a priority queue object to hold all PrintJob objects and then uses a loop to output the order of the printing jobs. For the test purpose, it assumes that the user names of these printing jobs are John, David, Peter, Adam and Bob. Their file sizes are respectively 1000, 5000, 3500, 2000, and 4400 (the unit is Kbyte).
